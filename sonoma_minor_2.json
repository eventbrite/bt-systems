Save all your work, and close all open windows.\n2. Navigate to System Settings (via the Finder window or by clicking the Apple icon at the top left of your screen).\n3. In System Settings, navigate to General > Software Update and click on ‘Update Now’, and your device will update itself to the latest version (including a restart).\n\nThank you for your time and help in ensuring that the Britespace remains at its most secure.",
